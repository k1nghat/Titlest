# Titlest

this is a simple extension to replace or append a websites title with whatever you want. the extension name is a play on the golf brand. no i dont like golf.

## Overview

im trying to learn javascript and i figured this would be a good place to go as it solves a problem i have. some of the web apps/pages i use dont have a consistent or common title to be able to easily select them in an overview. with this i can set them to what i want.

the code is probably sloppy and redundant but its part of the learning process.

# Titlest

a simple extension to replace or append a websites title with whatever you want. the extension name is a play on the golf brand. no, i dont like golf.

## Overview

im trying to learn javascript and i figured this would be a good place to start as it solves a problem i have. some of the web apps/pages i use dont have a consistent or common title to be able to easily select them in an overview. with this i can set them to what i want.

the code is sloppy and probably redundant but its part of the learning process.

## Installation

_before i push the extension to the respective browser stores i need to convert from sync storage to local storage. so be warned that your data could could be lost in an update. i also need to make it cross browser compatible with firefox._

-   first you need to put the files on your local system by cloning or downloading the repository and extracting it.

-   to install in chrome go to `chrome://extensions/` in your navigation bar. turn on "Developer Mode" in the top right and the click on the "Load unpacked" in the top left. select the `src/` directory. it should now be loaded as an "unpacked extension."
